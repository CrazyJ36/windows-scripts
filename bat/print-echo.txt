-Create new text file named "filename.bat"

-Example code syntax:

@echo off
echo I used '@echo off' so you don't see commands automatically input
echo to the command prompt just to see these lines as the result.
echo I used 'echo' for these lines to be read to you.
echo I'll use 'pause' to hold the program until your finished reading:
pause
